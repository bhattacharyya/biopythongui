This is a GUI front-end for the BioPython module. BioPython is a module for python that contains tool for bioinformatics researchers. One problem with BioPython is that in order to use it in a powerful way one must be a python developer. This will change this. This will be designed basically to retrieve biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins) from online databases, such as NCBI, and bring those sequences into an environment where it is easy to manipulate them. Also, This will interface to BLAST and MEME so that researchers can use these tools as well, integrated with the database lookups. There will be many other features as well such as translating/transcribing DNA, RNA, and protein, visualizing the different sequences, modeling and genetic algorithm support, integrated command line for directly using python to manipulate sequences, and scripting. This will have most, if not all, of the features BioPython has, only instead of a messy code-driven interface, it will be graphical.
