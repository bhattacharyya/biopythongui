Adsat is a GUI front-end for the BioPython module. BioPython is a module for python that contains tool for bioinformatics researchers. One problem with BioPython is that in order to use it in a powerful way one must be a python developer. Adsat will change this.
Adset will be designed basically to retrieve biological sequences (DNA, RNA, proteins) from online databases, such as NCBI, and bring those sequences into an environment where it is easy to minipulate them. Also, Adsat will interface to BLAST and MEME so that researchers can use these tools as well, integrated with the database lookups. There will be many other features as well such as tranlating/transcribing DNA, RNA, and protein, visualizing the different sequences, modeling and genetic algorithm support, integrated command line for directly using python to manipulate sequences, and scripting. Adsat will have most, if not all, of the features BioPython has, only instead of a messy code-driven interface, it will be graphical.

Adsat will be written in Python and will use the GTK graphics library. For all of the database lookups and BLAST integration and other bioinformatic functions, BioPython will be used. Possibly in the future, Adsat will be threaded, using python's thread module, so that it can do large database lookups while the user will be able to continue to work on his or her project.
